## Hello there 👋

I'm Justin, a third-year Software Engineering student at SJSU! This is my GitHub page, please feel free to look around and explore the different projects that I have been working on 🙌. 

If you would like, you could also visit my personal portfolio website that I created. It's really simple, but I designed it so it's good 💯. <br /> Link can be found under my beautiful face to the left (top if you're on mobile 📱) or navigate to it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://justin-zhu1018.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. Please note that it takes about 30 seconds to load if left inactive for too long due to Heroku restrictions 🔥.
